## 🌱 About Me

I’m passionate about building technology that solves real-world problems — whether it’s AI/ML modeling, data engineering, digital twins, automation, or smart analytics pipelines. 
My journey has taken me through research at Texas Tech University, Engineering outreach activities + involvement work at Whitacre College of Engineering, and hands-on AI/ML experience through **Break Through Tech AI Studio (Cornell Tech)**.

Along the way, I’ve developed a strong foundation in:

- Machine Learning & Model Evaluation  
- Data Engineering + Pipelines (Python, SQL, Power BI, Smartsheet API)  
- Cyber-physical systems & digital twin concepts  
- Dashboarding, analytics, and automation for enterprise workflows  

I love working on projects that blend data, modeling, and practical impact, and I’m always looking for opportunities to grow in AI/ML, fintech, and applied research.
